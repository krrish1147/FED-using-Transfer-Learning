Recognizing emotions on the face is a critical component of Human Computer Interaction and is essential to daily living. 
Convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, have gained a lot of traction among researchers in recent years for image processing due to their impressive output. But in order to train from scratch, CNNs require a large amount of data. 
Many researchers have tackled this issue by training CNNs on millions of photos; this training data can also be applied to another task, a process called transfer learning.
Among the greatest CNNs with pre-training is AlexNet. 
Our research presents a succinct comparison of the use of hybrid classifiers, also known as support vector machines (SVM) or transfer learning with classification techniques, vs state-of-theart pre-trained CNNs. 
The examination has been conducted on two widely used expression databases: Natural Visible and Infrared Expression (NVIE) and Cohn-Kanade+ (CK+) database. 
The results unequivocally show that handcrafted methods are inferior to those produced by pre-trained CNNs.
